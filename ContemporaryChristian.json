The angels roar for Christ the King  O praise the name of the Lord our God O praise His name forevermore For endless days we will sing Your praise Oh Lord, oh Lord our God  He shall return in robes of white The blazing sun shall pierce the night And I will rise among the saints My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face  O praise the name of the Lord our God O praise His name forever more For endless days we will sing Your praise Oh Lord, oh Lord our God Oh Lord, oh Lord our God Oh Lord, oh Lord our God",
